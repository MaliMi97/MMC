This is a program, which I submitted in the subject called The Monte Carlo Method. The program simulates pedestrians walking in a single lane and one direction. I used two models: Parallel and Random, both of which are in file TASEPv3.py. The class DataProcessing in file DataProcessing_v3.py is used to process the data, which are obtained from the simulations. It also taked the type of model as a parameter. Lastly the file Results_v3 has functions which are used to visualize the results.

All of the classes and functions mentioned above are used together in jupyter notebook file TASEPv3.ipynb. There the models are used to simulate the pedestrians and obtain data, which are then processed and finally, an output is produced.
